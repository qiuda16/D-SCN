# D-SCN

Pose-graph optimization for efficient tie-point matching and 3D scene reconstruction from oblique UAV images

An optimized Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline for oblique UAV imagery that reduces computational costs by 60-70% through intelligent pose graph simplification.

## Key Features
- 🚀 **Two-stage graph optimization**: Combines geometric and topological constraints
- 📊 **Data-driven edge weighting**: Analyzes 5 critical overlap parameters
- ⚡ **Computationally efficient**: Maintains accuracy while reducing matching pairs
- 🛩️ **UAV-optimized**: Designed for 5-camera oblique imaging systems
